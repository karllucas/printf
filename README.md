Project 0x11. C-printf

In this project, we come up with a replication of the printf() C standard library function using the knowledge we have obtained so far in the ALX SWE course.

All code will be compiled using;
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c

The prototypes of all the functions used are included in the header file main.h

Tasks

0. Function that produces output according to a format
Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
Conversion specifiers:
1. c
2. s
3. %

1. Handling of conversion specifiers
1. d
2. i

2. man page for the function
File: man_3_printf
